cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_reflections.txt (you can replace subl with another editor here if you prefer a different one)

pwd # print working directory - shows what directory you are in
ls  # list the files in this directory

Q: how could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A: it allows you to see past work and new work side by side and helps you to inprove your work.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A: Pro- you know when you did something good or big and when it is a good time to save this new version.
Con- if you are bad at saving you may miss something big and then get stuck!
